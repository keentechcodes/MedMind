# MedMind Enhancement Strategy & Roadmap

**Date**: January 8, 2025  
**Status**: **PydanticAI Architecture Implementation**  
**Next Phase**: Coordinator Agent + Quiz Agent Development

## 🎯 Strategic Vision

Transform MedMind from a basic PDF Q&A system into a comprehensive AI-powered medical education platform using **PydanticAI multi-agent architecture** for specialized learning assistance, adaptive education, and intelligent tutoring.
