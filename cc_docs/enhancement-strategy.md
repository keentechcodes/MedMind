# MedMind Enhancement Strategy & Roadmap

**Date**: January 8, 2025  
**Status**: Strategic Planning Phase  
**Next Phase**: Active Learning Foundation Implementation

## 🎯 Strategic Vision

Transform MedMind from a basic PDF Q&A system into a comprehensive AI-powered medical education platform that actively engages students through adaptive learning, progress tracking, and validated medical content.

## 📊 Current State Analysis

### ✅ Strengths
- **Solid RAG Foundation**: Working retrieval-augmented generation with source attribution
