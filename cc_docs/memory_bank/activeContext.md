# Active Context: Current State & Focus

## Current Status: Production Ready ✅

**Major Milestone Achieved**: Successfully transformed from prototype script collection to professional Python package with complete root directory cleanup.

## Recent Changes (Latest Session)

### Root Directory Cleanup Completed
- **Removed**: 4 outdated duplicate files from root (document_processor.py, embeddings_service.py, rag_system.py, streamlit_app.py)
- **Organized**: Moved 5 files to `examples/` (simple_streamlit.py, simple_rag.py, main.py, setup_rag.py, batch_test.py)
- **Structured**: Moved 2 files to `tests/` (test_auth.py, test_gemini_embeddings.py)
- **Updated**: Fixed all import statements and removed hardcoded API keys
- **Documented**: Added comprehensive cleanup documentation to setup-summary.md

## Current Work Focus

**Memory Bank Initialization**: Setting up persistent memory system for future development sessions.

## Next Steps Priority

1. **High**: Memory bank completion (systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, progress.md)
2. **Medium**: System testing and validation after reorganization
3. **Low**: Performance optimization and feature enhancements

## Key Decisions Made

- **Structure**: Professional Python package over script collection
- **Security**: Environment variables over hardcoded credentials
- **Organization**: Clear separation of production vs example code
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for setup and development

## Important Patterns

- Always use `physiology_rag.core.*` imports for production code
- Examples in `examples/` are clearly marked as debugging tools
- All configuration through environment variables
- Maintain clean root directory with only essential files

## Current System Health

- ✅ 13 physiology documents processed
- ✅ 643 chunks in vector database
- ✅ Working Streamlit interface
- ✅ Complete RAG pipeline operational
- ✅ Professional package structure implemented
