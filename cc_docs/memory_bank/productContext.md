# Product Context: Physiology RAG System

## Why This Exists

Medical students studying physiology face challenges:
- Large volumes of complex lecture material
- Need quick access to specific information
- Difficulty connecting concepts across multiple documents
- Time-consuming manual search through PDFs

## Problem Statement

**Before**: Students manually search through multiple PDF lecture documents, losing time and missing connections between concepts.

**After**: Students ask natural language questions and get accurate answers with exact source citations from their physiology materials.

## User Experience Goals

### Primary Users: Medical Students

**Core Workflow**:
1. Upload physiology PDF lectures
2. System automatically processes and indexes content
3. Ask questions in natural language via chat interface
4. Receive accurate answers with source citations
5. Explore related concepts through source links

### User Experience Principles

- **Immediate Value**: System works out-of-box with provided physiology documents
- **Trust Through Citations**: Every answer shows exact source location and relevance score
- **Conversational**: Natural language questions, not keyword search
- **Educational**: Answers tailored for medical student comprehension level

## Success Metrics

- Students can find answers faster than manual PDF search
- High accuracy with proper source attribution
- Easy setup and deployment for educational institutions
- Extensible for additional document types and features

## Future Vision
